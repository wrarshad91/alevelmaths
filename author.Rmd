Waqar is passionate about the teaching and learning of mathematics.

He prides himself in his ability to break down mathematical concepts and teach them to learners no matter what stage in their learning journey they are.

When he is not teaching or tutoring, Waqar enjoys playing cricket recreationally as a batsman. He also like to exercise and play fighting games such as \textit{Tekken 8}.
